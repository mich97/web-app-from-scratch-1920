## Routie
Routie is a javascript hash routing library. It is designed for scenarios when push state is not an option (IE8 support, static/Github pages, Phonegap, simple sites, etc). It is very tiny (800 bytes gzipped). Routie is used for the home and detailpage routing. Documentation can be found [here](http://projects.jga.me/routie/).

## Transparency
Transparency is a client-side template engine which binds data to DOM. Transparency is current only used to build the detailpage. Documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/leonidas/transparency).
