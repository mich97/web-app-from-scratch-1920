## API
This web-app was made by making use of the Marvel API. The Marvel Comics API allows developers everywhere to access information about Marvel's vast library of comicsâ€”from what's coming up, to 70 years ago, 3000 calls can be made daily. Documentation can be found [here](https://developer.marvel.com/docs).
